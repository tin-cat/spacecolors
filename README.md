A CSS repository and experiment to document and explore the real colors of the planets and other space bodies as they might appear to the human eye.

All the colors have been carefully picked after a thorough study from multiple sources (See references) and are considered (by the people contributing to this project) the most accurate colors that represent how the space body would look to a human eye if they were orbiting the body.

See the colors and learn more about the project here: [url]https://spacecolors.io[/url]

[b]Instructions[/b]
You'll find the colors in the spaceBodiesColors.css file. All CSS classes assign the colors as backgrounds. Each space body has three colors and a gradient:

[list]
[*][b]Primary color[/b] The most predominant natural accurate color that is considered to be the most representative color of the space body.
[*][b]Secondary color[/b] A second natural accurate color that is also considered to be representative of the space body.
[*][b]Tertiary color[/b] A third natural accurate color that is also considered to be representative of the space body.
[*][b]Gradient[/b] A vertical gradient using various natural and accurate colors of the space body that represents a simplified but representative view of the contrasts, variances and characteristics.
[/list]

[b]Currently documented space bodies[/b]

[list]
[*]sun
[*]mercury
[*]venus
[*]earth
[*]moon
[*]mars
[*]jupiter
[*]saturn
[*]uranus
[*]neptune
[*]pluto
[/list]

[b]How to use[/b]
Import the spaceBodiesColors.css file to your project and assign the CSS classes in your HTML as follows:

[list]
[*][b].spaceBodyBackgroundColor.[Space body name].primary[/b] To color the element's background with the primary color of the space body.
[*][b].spaceBodyBackgroundColor.[Space body name].secondary[/b] To color the element's background with the secondary color of the space body.
[*][b].spaceBodyBackgroundColor.[Space body name].tertiary[/b] To color the element's background with the tertiary color of the space body.
[*][b].spaceBodyBackgroundGradient.[Space body name][/b] To color the element's background with a vertical gradient that represents the space body.
[/list]

Of course, you can just take a look at the Red, Green and Blue values in the CSS code and use the color for any specific purposes. If you're new to CSS, you'll find the colors there in the syntax: .spaceBodyBackgroundColor.[b][Space body name][/b].primary { background-color: rgb([b][Red][/b],[b][Green][/b],[b][Blue][/b]); }
